## Introduction
In my previous role, I was given the opportunity to build a Business Intelligence Dashboard to monitor performance and sales activities in real-time.

The project was a solution to a business challenge where:

+ The data was messy and unclean.
+ The requirement was clear: everything should be monitored and easily understandable.
+ The dashboard needed to show how activities impact the business along with an eye-catching design.

With due respect to the confidentiality of my previous organization, I have replaced the real data with dummy data, while ensuring the functionality and design remain the same.
